### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The basic design and layout helped prepare for the assigment. I felt like I had to do a lot of outside reaserch for the more complex parts of the js, such as populating the modals with the songs. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would re-structure all my code to make the adding playlist goal easier to acheave. A lot of my functions won't work as-is to create new playlists.


* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think my project demo went well, I may not have had as many features as others but after I finished 2 of the stretch goals I ended up spending a decent amount of time helping others around me.

### Shout out

I'm still learning everyones names, but in general it was very helpful to discuss how others are doing their project. Dominic was helping in talking to and working through code.
